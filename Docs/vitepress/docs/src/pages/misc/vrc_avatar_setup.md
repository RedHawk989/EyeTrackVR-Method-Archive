# How to set up your avatar for eye tracking:

Currently, the best resource is the [VRC Face Tracking GitHub](https://github.com/benaclejames/VRCFaceTracking/wiki/Eye-Tracking-Setup) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/Fh4FNehzKn).

I hope to have a good video available from a community member that shows and explains the process eventually.
