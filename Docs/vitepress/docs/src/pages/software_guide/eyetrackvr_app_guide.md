# How to install, run and adjust the EyeTrackVR app.

### Step 1: Download the EyeTrackVR Installer and install the EyeTrackVR app.

Go to the latest [GitHub release here](https://github.com/RedHawk989/EyeTrackVR-Installer/releases/latest) and download the .zip

Extract the zip file and then run the .exe as administrator.
You will be greeted with a window that looks like this:
{% include custom/images/image_2.html url="https://i.imgur.com/olwRFYI.png" max-width="500" caption="" alt="" %}

By default, it will install to `C:\Program Files\EyeTrackVR` and create a shortcut on your desktop.
Pressing the `Change Install Path` button will open up a window where you can navigate to an alternate install path.

Press `Install` to install the app. 
{% include custom/alerts/Note.html content=" The installer can also be used to update the app, just go through the install process again." %}

If it has been successfully installed it should change to look like this:

## Step 2: Run the EyeTrackVR app.

If the `Create Desktop Shortcut` option was checked you should see an icon on your desktop, double click it to run.

You then should be greeted with a GUI that looks like this:

## Step 3: Getting familiar with settings and terminology.

Let's go over some basic terminology you will find in the app.

Starting from the top:

### `Right eye`: 
Shows the right eye feed and settings only.

###  `Left eye`: 
Shows the left eye feed and settings only.

### `Both eyes`: 
Shows both eyes' feed and settings.

### `Camera Address`:
This is where you enter the IP address of your camera.
Alternatively, it can be used to put the cam number for wired cameras or pass in a video file.

### `Tracking Mode`: 
This changes the GUI to the tracking mode where it outputs values.

### `Cropping Mode`: 
This is where you will crop out your eye. 

### `Threshold`: 
This is used to cut out things that aren't dark like your pupil.

### `Rotation`: 
For our method to work best, you want your eye to be level. 
Use this slider to adjust it to where that is the case.

### `Restart Calibrationn`: 
This will start a calibration mode for your eye where you look to all extremes.

### `Recenter Eye`: 
This will recenter your eye to whatever point you are looking at.


## Step 4: Adding your cameras to the software and configuring them.
Power your ESPs and find what the IP address is for your right eye. This can be done by opening both Cameras in a browser and then holding your finger over your right eye camera. 

Copy that IP address and then close the browser tab with it open.

Enter that IP address into the app's `Camera Address` field and press the `Save and Restart Tracking` button.

Don't see your camera feed? That's because we haven't set an ROI.

Now press the `Cropping Mode` button.
You should see a feed of your camera.

Put your headset on and use an application to see your desktop. (Virtual desktop, SteamVR desktop, etc.)

You should see something like this:
{% include custom/images/image_2.html url="https://i.imgur.com/1pNYITS.png" max-width="500" caption=":O It's my eye!" alt="" %}

Now, Draw a rectangle that selects your eye.

A good example of an ROI
{% include custom/images/image_2.html url="https://i.imgur.com/HZSvFBv.png" max-width="500" caption="" alt="" %}

Head back over to the `Tracking mode`.

We will now adjust our rotation by moving the `Rotation` slider.

From this:
{% include custom/images/image_2.html url="https://i.imgur.com/xXTB3sM.png" max-width="500" caption="It's crooked!" alt="" %}

To this:
{% include custom/images/image_2.html url="https://i.imgur.com/blsrpCX.png" max-width="500" caption="Much better" alt="" %}

Now we will adjust our threshold.

Continuing with your headset on, move the slider all the way up.
start slowly backing it off until mainly only your pupil is being visualized in the threshold viewer.

Example of a threshold being too low:
{% include custom/images/image_2.html url="https://i.imgur.com/30fFadH.png" max-width="500" caption="" alt="" %}

Example of too high of a threshold:
{% include custom/images/image_2.html url="https://i.imgur.com/ZjpKfCV.png" max-width="500" caption="" alt="" %}

Example of a good threshold:
{% include custom/images/image_2.html url="https://i.imgur.com/KPUn8S1.png" max-width="500" caption="" alt="" %}

Repeat everything in this step for your left eye.

## Step 5: Calibrating your eyes.

Once your eye is trackable by the software we need to calibrate it.

Press the `Restart Calibration` button and look around.
The important part is that you look to all extremes, all the way up, left, etc.
Once you have done so, wait for the `Mode` to say `Tracking`

The next step is to center your eye.

Look straight forward and press the `Recenter Eye` button.

Your eye is now fully calibrated.

Repeat for your other eye.
{% include custom/alerts/Note.html content=" To best center both eyes, look at one spot and hit the 'Recenter Eye' button for each eye without moving your eyes." %}
